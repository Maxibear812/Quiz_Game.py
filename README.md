Welcome to the readme for my quiz game written in Python!

This quiz game is designed to test your knowledge of simple computer hardware and terminology. It includes five questions on different topics, and for each question, you'll have to input your answer. If your answer is correct, you'll see a message indicating that you got it right, and your score will increase by 1. If your answer is incorrect, you'll see a message indicating that you got it wrong, and you'll have to try again. 

At the end, you'll get your score out of 100%, and a message based on that percentage. 

Here's a breakdown of the questions you'll encounter in the game:

What does CPU stand for?
What does GPU stand for?
What does PSU stand for?
What does RAM stand for?
What does SSD stand for?
After you've answered all four questions, the game will display your final score and percentage.

To play the game, simply run the script and follow the prompts in the terminal. You can input your answers in any case, and the game will check if your answer is correct or not. If you want to quit the game at any point, type "quit" and press enter.

I hope you enjoy playing the game, and I hope it helps you learn more about computer hardware and terminology!
